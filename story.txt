Lucas was a person who lived in the woods all alone. One day he ran across a wolf on his way home. He asked this wolf what was going on in his life, and the wolf responded with a long story about his day.

The wolf went on his merry way home, and so did Lucas. After he went home he ate his cake.

After a week, Lucas ran across the wolf and another wolf on his way home. Again, he asked the wolf what was going on in his life and who is the other wolf. The two wolves responded with a longer story about their day. Lucas and the wolves went on his merry way home.

This time, when Lucas reached home, he was surprised to see the two wolves at his house already. When Lucas asked them what they were doing here, they replied that they wanted to talk to Lucas more. Since then, Lucas and the two wolves havebeen inseperable.
