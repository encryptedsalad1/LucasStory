Lucas was a person who lived in the woods all alone. One day he ran across a wolf on his way home. He asked this wolf what was going on in his life, and the wolf responded with a long story about his day.

The wolf went on his merry way home, and so did Lucas. After he went home he ate his cake.

After a week, Lucas ran across the wolf and another wolf on his way home. Again, he asked the wolf what was going on in his life and who is the other wolf. The two wolves responded with a longer story about their day. Lucas and the wolves went on his merry way home.

This time, when Lucas reached home, he was surprised to see the two wolves at his house already. When Lucas asked them what they were doing here, they replied that they wanted to talk to Lucas more. Since then, Lucas and the two wolves havebeen inseperable.

However with two wolves, came more wolves, and within a few weeks, a whole wolf pack was residing at Lucas's home. Having no clue what to do, Lucas decided to meditate a solution. 

Lucas began to host the wolf club at his house, and from that day on he was known as one of the favorite people among the wolf community.aa
